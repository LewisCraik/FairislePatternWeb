# Fairisle Pattern Designer

Web based template for designing Fairisle knitting patterns. Originally requested by my Mum.

The grid is 127 across (+ row count column) and 130 down. With the option of 6 symbols to populate the grid, and a text area at the bottom for notes, such as documenting what is meant by each symbol on your design.

## Built using

Based on [Bootstrap 5](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/v5.0.2), but with some custom CSS for the grid. The JavaScript to control the symbols is all in js/script.js.
